- What is KNN Imputer and how does it work?
KNN Imputer imputes missing values in a dataset compared to traditional methods like using mean, median, or mode. It is based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which fills missing values by referencing the values of the nearest neighbors.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Neighborhood-based Imputation: The KNN Imputer identifies the k nearest neighbors to the data point with the missing value, based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
Imputation Process: Once the nearest neighbors are found, the missing value is imputed (filled) using a statistical measure, such as the mean or median, of the values from these neighbors.
Distance Parameter: The k parameter is used to define how many neighbors to consider when imputing a missing value, and the distance metric controls how similarity is measured between data points.
