1. What is KNN Imputer and how does it work?
KNN Imputer imputes missing values in a dataset compared to traditional methods like using mean, median, or mode. It is based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which fills missing values by referencing the values of the nearest neighbors.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Neighborhood-based Imputation: The KNN Imputer identifies the k nearest neighbors to the data point with the missing value, based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).<br>
Imputation Process: Once the nearest neighbors are found, the missing value is imputed (filled) using a statistical measure, such as the mean or median, of the values from these neighbors.
Distance Parameter: The k parameter is used to define how many neighbors to consider when imputing a missing value, and the distance metric controls how similarity is measured between data points.


2. Explain some methods to handle missing values in that data.
Some of the methods to handle missing values are as follows:

Removing the rows with null values may lead to the loss of some important information.
Removing the column having null values if it has very less valuable information. it may lead to the loss of some important information.
Imputing null values with descriptive statistical measures like mean, mode, and median.
Using methods like KNN Imputer to impute the null values in a more sophisticated way.
