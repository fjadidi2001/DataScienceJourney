The ambiguity of data science buzzwords mainly affects those who are new to the field or lack technical expertise

Analytics is essentially the application of logical and computational reasoning to the component parts obtained in an analysis: This definition is the most accurate as it captures the essence of what analytics is about. Analytics involves breaking down complex data into smaller parts and using logical and computational methods to analyze those parts in order to gain insights, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.

>  Preliminary data reporting is a data analytics activity that involves the initial exploration and analysis of data to identify trends, anomalies, and patterns. This process typically involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, exploring it using visualizations and statistical techniques, and identifying any data quality issues that need to be addressed. Creating dashboards is a data analytics activity that involves the development of interactive and visual representations of data to provide insights and facilitate decision-making. Dashboards can help users quickly identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in their data. Digital signal processing is a data analytics activity that involves the analysis of digital signals such as audio, video, and images to extract meaningful information and insights. This type of analysis is used in a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, medical imaging, and video processing. All of the options listed are data analytics activities, and none of them are excluded from the field of data analytics. Therefore, option 4 is the correct answer.

>  From a data scientist's perspective, the process of solving a task typically begins with obtaining a proper dataset. Data is the foundation for any data-driven analysis or modeling. Without a suitable dataset, it would be challenging to perform any meaningful analysis, develop predictive models, or gain insights. The other options, while important in the overall process, usually come after acquiring the necessary data. Once a suitable dataset is available, data scientists can propose different solutions (Option 1), discuss approaches with their team (Option 2), and analyze historical data (Option 4) to gain insights and develop effective solutions for the given task.

Traditional data science methods involve using statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret data to gain insights and inform decision-making, including predictive analytics. They focus on modeling relationships between variables and making predictions about future outcomes. traditional methods, which involve predictive analytics and do not solely aim at explaining past behavior.
