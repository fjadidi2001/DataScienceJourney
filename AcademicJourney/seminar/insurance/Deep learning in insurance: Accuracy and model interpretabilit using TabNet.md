**Summary of the Article "Deep Learning in Insurance: Accuracy and Model Interpretability Using TabNet"**

1. **Introduction**:  
   The paper focuses on using telematics data in the insurance industry for risk pricing and claims prediction. Traditional models like Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and XGBoost are popular but have limitations, especially with high-dimensional, non-linear data like telematics. The article proposes TabNet, a Deep Learning (DL) architecture, as an alternative to better handle this data while also providing interpretability, a key requirement for regulatory compliance in the insurance sector [source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423000441).

2. **Dataset and Pre-processing**:  
   The authors use a synthetic telematics dataset based on real-world data from a Canadian insurer, including traditional policyholder data, telematics data, and claims information. They create a binary response variable, ‘ClaimYN,’ to indicate whether a driver is considered risky based on the number and amount of claims. Pre-processing levels range from minimal data normalization to advanced feature engineering, testing TabNet against GLM and XGBoost models [source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423000441).

3. **Methodology**:  
   TabNet, a novel DL model, is designed for high-dimensional data and offers sequential processing with attention mechanisms to select important features. The authors compare TabNet’s accuracy, model interpretability, and need for pre-processing against XGBoost and GLM. Multiple performance metrics are used, including F1-score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. TabNet’s local interpretability is achieved via decision masks that reveal feature importance at different steps [source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423000441).

4. **Results**:  
   TabNet outperforms XGBoost and GLM in terms of F1-score, precision, and recall on most tasks, especially with high recall, which is critical for detecting risky drivers. However, TabNet requires more computational resources and effort in hyperparameter tuning. Despite these challenges, TabNet provides superior interpretability compared to XGBoost and GLM, which struggle with model transparency[source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423000441).

5. **Discussion and Innovations**:  
   TabNet proves to be a robust solution for telematics-based insurance pricing, capturing the complexity of the data and delivering interpretable results. However, the model tends to overfit and is computationally expensive to train. XGBoost remains competitive with less effort but lacks the same level of feature interpretability. Logistic Regression (GLM) performed poorly in comparison, especially on complex data.[source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423000441)

6. **Conclusion**:  
   TabNet is recommended as a powerful, interpretable DL model for insurance applications, offering a strong balance between predictive performance and interpretability. Its ability to handle telematics data and identify meaningful features can help insurers develop more accurate and transparent pricing models[source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423000441).

### Main Innovations in the Article:

1. **Application of TabNet to Insurance**:  
   While TabNet, introduced by Arik and Pfister in 2021, was initially proposed for tabular data in general, this article is the **first to apply TabNet to insurance telematics data** for risk pricing and claims prediction. This is a novel contribution as insurance companies typically rely on GLMs and other traditional models, making this application a step forward in using deep learning within the industry.[source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423000441)

2. **Improved Interpretability in Deep Learning Models**:  
   One of the major innovations is demonstrating **how TabNet provides interpretable results in a deep learning context**. This is significant because deep learning models are often seen as black boxes, which is problematic in regulated industries like insurance, where transparency is necessary. TabNet’s use of decision masks to highlight the importance of features and the sequence of decision steps helps to bridge this gap between accuracy and interpretability.

3. **Handling Complex High-dimensional Data**:  
   Another innovation is showing how **TabNet can outperform both traditional models (GLM) and ensemble learning models (XGBoost)** on tasks involving high-dimensional data such as telematics. The article provides empirical evidence that TabNet captures complex, non-linear patterns in the data that are often missed by GLMs while offering competitive performance compared to XGBoost【5†source】.

4. **Focus on Minimal Pre-processing and Feature Engineering**:  
   The paper emphasizes TabNet’s ability to **reduce the need for extensive feature engineering** while still achieving high accuracy. This simplifies the workflow for insurers, who would otherwise need to spend a lot of time manually tuning their models. The study evaluates different levels of pre-processing (minimal, moderate, and extensive) to show TabNet's effectiveness across these levels【5†source】【5†source】.

### Introduction of `ClaimYN`:

`ClaimYN` is a newly created binary response variable that classifies drivers as risky or not, based on two existing variables:
- `NB_Claim` (number of claims made by a policyholder).
- `AMT_Claim` (aggregated claims amount paid out by the insurer).

The **classification rule** for ClaimYN is defined as:
- `ClaimYN = 1`: The driver is considered a risk if they have made more than one claim (`NB_Claim > 1`) and the total claims amount is greater than €1,000 (`AMT_Claim > €1,000`).
- `ClaimYN = 0`: Otherwise, the driver is not considered a risk.

This newly introduced target variable helps the model distinguish risky from non-risky drivers, making the insurance risk classification task more focused.

### Explanation of Preprocessing Levels:

1. **Level 1 (Minimal Pre-processing)**:
   - **Preprocessing**: Minimal steps are taken here. The only changes involve encoding categorical variables such as gender and car use into numerical values, allowing the models to process the data. No scaling or normalization is applied.
   - **Goal**: This test aims to see how well the models (TabNet, XGBoost, and GLM) perform on raw data without significant pre-processing efforts.

2. **Level 2 (Moderate Pre-processing)**:
   - **Preprocessing**: Additional steps like data normalization (using `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`) are introduced to scale numerical features into a standard range. Minor hyperparameter tuning is also conducted to improve model performance.
   - **Goal**: This phase evaluates whether moderate pre-processing steps, like scaling and basic hyperparameter tuning, improve model performance and whether TabNet’s performance advantages still hold.

3. **Level 3 (Advanced Pre-processing)**:
   - **Preprocessing**: This phase involves more **extensive feature engineering**. Correlated variables like harsh acceleration and braking (e.g., `Accel.xxmiles`, `Brake.xxmiles`) are aggregated to simplify the model’s task. Optimal hyperparameters are extracted using **RandomizedSearchCV**, and additional tuning is performed to fine-tune model performance.
   - **Goal**: This final level tests how models perform when full pre-processing steps are applied, including feature engineering, data scaling, and hyperparameter optimization. TabNet's performance is compared against XGBoost and GLM to assess robustness.

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into **Figure 3: Feature Masks for TabNet** from the article.

### Overview of Figure 3

**Figure 3** in the article illustrates the **feature masks** generated by the TabNet model during training at each level of pre-processing (Levels 1 to 3). The feature masks are a visual representation of how TabNet selects and weighs different features when making predictions about whether a driver is risky (`ClaimYN = 1`) or not (`ClaimYN = 0`).

### Understanding Feature Masks in TabNet

**Feature Masks** are an intrinsic component of TabNet's architecture that contribute to its interpretability:

- **Decision Steps**: TabNet processes data through multiple sequential decision steps. At each step, the model decides which features to focus on next.
- **Attentive Transformer and Masks**: At each decision step, an *Attentive Transformer* generates a mask that highlights the importance of each feature for that specific step.
- **Sparse Feature Selection**: The masks enforce sparsity, meaning at each step, only a subset of features is considered important, which helps in focusing the model's attention and aids interpretability.

### Structure of Figure 3

- **Rows**: Each row corresponds to one of the three levels of pre-processing applied to the data:
  - **Level 1**: Minimal pre-processing.
  - **Level 2**: Moderate pre-processing with scaling and normalization.
  - **Level 3**: Advanced pre-processing with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Columns**: Each column represents a decision step within the TabNet model. The number of decision steps may vary depending on the model's configuration for each level.
- **Axes**:
  - **X-axis**: Sample indices from the test data.
  - **Y-axis**: Feature indices corresponding to the input features used in the model.
- **Color Gradient**:
  - **Yellow**: High importance—features that significantly influence the model's decision at that step.
  - **Purple**: Low importance—features that have little to no influence at that step.

### Interpretation of Feature Masks at Each Pre-processing Level
