        "> Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a type of neural network that leverages both data and physical laws (represented by differential equations) to model complex systems. They are particularly useful for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), where traditional numerical methods may be computationally expensive or infeasible. PINNs incorporate these physical laws as part of the loss function, allowing the network to not only fit data but also adhere to the governing physics."
