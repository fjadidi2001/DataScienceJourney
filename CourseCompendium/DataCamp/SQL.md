# Introducing Databases

A database is a system for storing and organizing data. For example, in a library, a database can hold information about patrons, books, and checkouts, organized into tables with rows and columns. 

The **patrons table** contains data such as library card number, name, membership year, and overdue fines. A **relational database** establishes relationships between these tables, allowing us to answer questions like which books a patron checked out or which books are most frequently checked out.

While tables in databases may resemble those in spreadsheet applications like Excel, databases offer greater storage capacity and enhanced security through encryption. A key advantage of databases is that multiple users can simultaneously write queries to extract insights from the data without altering it.

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is the primary programming language used to create, query, and update relational databases. Familiarity with the data and its organization allows us to write SQL queries to gain insights, which will be explored further in Chapter Two.
