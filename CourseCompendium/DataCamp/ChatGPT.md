# Limitations of ChatGPT

Although ChatGPT is a valuable tool that can perform a huge variety of tasks, there are some limitations to be aware of to use it effectively.

## ChatGPT Under the Hood

- ChatGPT's text-generation capabilities come from a large language model (LLM) that interprets prompts and generates relevant text based on its understanding of language.
- To understand some of the limitations of ChatGPT, we first need to delve deeper into how the LLM works.

## Demystifying the LLM

- Imagine we've been shown a large, complex building block wall and given an incomplete wall to finish in the same style. This analogy illustrates how ChatGPT functions.
- During development, the LLM was exposed to vast amounts of text data (the large building block wall), allowing it to understand the structure of language by analyzing the relationships between characters, words, and sentences (the differently colored building blocks).
- This learned data is referred to as *training data*, and its sheer volume and diversity contribute significantly to ChatGPT's success.
- The model utilized complex algorithms to detect language patterns in the training data and underwent fine-tuning through iterative processes, including rating the quality of the responses.
- When a prompt is provided to ChatGPT, it is effectively completing a building block wall by generating words based on the most likely continuation from its training data.

## Limitations of ChatGPT

1. **Knowledge Cutoff**  
   ChatGPT was trained on data up to a certain date, which varies depending on the model used. Without being directly provided with additional context, these models lack knowledge of events past these dates. As OpenAI updates the LLMs, these dates will continue to shift forward.
  
2. **Training Data Bias**  
   There is potential for bias in the training data. ChatGPT was trained on a large text dataset from various sources, including books, articles, and websites, which could contain biases. The model may learn these biases and produce biased responses.

3. **Context Tracking**  
   ChatGPT can build on information and context from earlier in the conversation, allowing for follow-up corrections. However, if the conversation topic shifts multiple times, ChatGPT may struggle to track context, leading to inaccurate or irrelevant responses. It's advisable to keep conversations focused on one topic and create new discussions for different topics.

4. **Hallucination**  
   Hallucination occurs when the model confidently provides inaccurate information, often when it goes beyond its knowledge cutoff or abilities. These inaccuracies can be challenging to identify without external validation. One of the active areas of LLM development is the identification and reduction of hallucinations.

5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**  
   Consider a scenario where we ask ChatGPT to write a new song in the style of our favorite artist. The resulting song may resemble the artist's style based on the lyrics available in the training data. However, ownership of this new song becomes complicated. Is it owned by the user who wrote the prompt, the original artist, or OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT? It's easy to navigate legal gray areas if the use cases for ChatGPT are not properly defined, which raises concerns about ownership and legal implications that will need to be addressed later in the course.



## Garbage in, garbage out
The phrase "garbage in, garbage out" emphasizes that the quality of the input prompts for ChatGPT directly affects the quality of the responses. Prompts lacking sufficient context or clarity are likely to yield poorer results.

## How ChatGPT Interprets a Prompt
ChatGPT interprets prompts by identifying the main topic and understanding the task being requested. It extracts key phrases that help shape the response, highlighting the importance of context in generating high-quality answers.

## Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering refers to crafting prompts to optimize the quality and relevance of the model's responses. Best practices in prompt engineering can greatly enhance the effectiveness of interactions with ChatGPT.

## Writing Tips for Prompt Engineering
1. **Be Clear and Specific**: Ensure the prompt includes all necessary context for the desired response.
2. **Keep Prompts Concise**: Remove unnecessary information to focus on key details.
3. **Use Correct Grammar and Spelling**: Proper grammar aids ChatGPT in accurately interpreting the task.

## Provide Examples if Necessary
Including examples in prompts can clarify the desired outcomes more efficiently than lengthy explanations. Examples help guide ChatGPT in producing responses that align with expectations, ensuring the output meets specific formatting or content requirements.
