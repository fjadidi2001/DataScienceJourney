# Robotics idea is not new

Mechanical Engineers are needed to build robots and physical structures.
<br>
They are responsible for designing and constructing robots including their mobility mechanisms, electronics and electrical engineers design systems that enable the robot to operate and control its action.
<br>
 SLAM is specifically used in robotics to map the environment and localize the robot within that environment. CNNs are more commonly used for processing image data, GANs for generating new data, and Neural Radiance Fields for 3D modeling.

# What is computer vision?

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning and neural networks to teach computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs and to make recommendations or take actions when they see defects or issues.
