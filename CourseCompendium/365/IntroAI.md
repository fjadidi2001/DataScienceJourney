# Robotics idea is not new

Mechanical Engineers are needed to build robots and physical structures.

<br>

They are responsible for designing and constructing robots including their mobility mechanisms, electronics and electrical engineers design systems that enable the robot to operate and control its action.

<br>
 SLAM is specifically used in robotics to map the environment and localize the robot within that environment. CNNs are more commonly used for processing image data, GANs for generating new data, and Neural Radiance Fields for 3D modeling.

# What is computer vision?

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning and neural networks to teach computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs and to make recommendations or take actions when they see defects or issues.

1. **Statistical NLP marked a shift from rule-based systems in the late 1980s** - True, as this shift allowed for more data-driven approaches.

2. **Word embeddings allow words to be represented as vectors in high-dimensional space** - True, this is a fundamental technique in modern NLP that captures semantic meanings.

3. **Transformer architecture revolutionized NLP and enabled the creation of large language models** - True, transformers have significantly advanced the capabilities of NLP through models like BERT and GPT.

The following statements are not accurate:

4. **Rule-based NLP systems became prominent in the 2010s with the introduction of neural networks** - False, rule-based systems were more prevalent before the rise of neural networks.

5. **NLP tasks have remained largely unchanged since the 1950s, focusing mainly on grammar rules** - False, NLP has evolved significantly, especially with the advancement of machine learning and deep learning techniques.
