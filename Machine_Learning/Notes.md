# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

is an essential first step in data science that focuses on analyzing and visualizing datasets to grasp their key characteristics, reveal patterns, detect outliers, and explore relationships between variables. This preliminary process typically precedes more formal statistical analyses or modeling.


The outlines key components of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Distribution of Data: Examining the distribution of data points to understand their range, central tendencies (mean, median), and dispersion (variance, standard deviation).
- Graphical Representations: Utilizing charts such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts to visualize relationships within the data and distributions of variables.
- Outlier Detection: Identifying unusual values that deviate from other data points. Outliers can influence statistical analyses and might indicate data entry errors or unique cases.
- Correlation Analysis: Checking the relationships between variables to understand how they might affect each other. This includes computing correlation coefficients and creating correlation matrices.
- Handling Missing Values: Detecting and deciding how to address missing data points, whether by imputation or removal, depending on their impact and the amount of missing data.
- Summary Statistics: Calculating key statistics that provide insight into data trends and nuances.
- Testing Assumptions: Many statistical tests and models assume the data meet certain conditions (like normality or homoscedasticity). EDA helps verify these assumptions.
